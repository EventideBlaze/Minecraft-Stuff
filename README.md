# Minecraft-Stuff
Little tidbits and silly stuff I made for minecraft (usually different origins)
To install an origin:
  Download the folder and put it in your world's "datapack" folder. [Placeholder]Origin should be the folder put in there. If you have origins installed, it should show up automatically. Then just select it and have fun.
